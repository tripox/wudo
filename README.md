# WUDO (Wedeluser do)

[WUDO](https://github.com/tripox/wudo) plugin â€” the sound of Ole Wedel when you run 'sudo'.

## Usage
Clone this repository into your oh-my-zsh 'custom/plugins' folder and activate it.
You need to install 'Sox' and maybe 'libsox-fmt-mp3', depending on your OS.

Use 'sudo', enjoy the power - and the sound!
